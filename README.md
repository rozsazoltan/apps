# Apps

In our releases, you can find desktop versions of popular websites. Our Rust-based applications offer better performance than a traditional PWA application.

With the installers provided here, you can install the application to a location of your choice. On first launch, the applications start with a resolution of 1200x780, but afterward, they remember the size and position from before closing.
