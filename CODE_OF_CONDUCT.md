# Contribution and Development Guidelines

The purpose of these guidelines is to achieve unified and clean development of the codebase.

## Rules

### 1. Development Proposals and Bug Reports

- Report all development proposals and bugs through issues to initiate evaluation and discussion.
- Critical vulnerabilities are exceptions and should be handled confidentially.
- Always check if the issue has already been reported.
- Use clear language and provide examples in the issues to facilitate understanding.

### 2. Handling Critical Bugs

- Handle critical bugs confidentially and only share them with relevant individuals, adhering to security guidelines. This minimizes potential risks and ensures a smooth fixing process.

### 3. Code Modifications and Pull Requests (PR)

- Introduce all code modifications through Pull Requests (PR) to allow the team to easily review and comment.
- The PR should explain the purpose of the code modification in detail, ideally referencing an issue. This promotes consistent development and helps document architectural decisions.
- Ensure the cleanliness of the PR code and compliance with the project's style guidelines. This contributes to easier maintainability and readable code.

### 4. Signature (GPG Key) for Commits

- Every commit should include a signature (GPG key) for authenticity. This strengthens code integrity and ensures that the origin of the changes can be verified.
- Signatures enhance code integrity and aid in identification. Ensure that every developer maintains an up-to-date and secure GPG key.

## Conclusion

This codex contributes to efficient communication, secure development, and maintaining code quality in the project. Thank you to every participant for committing to these guidelines, which helps ensure the success and long-term sustainability of our project.
